Database Object Model
========================

Java VAMDC-TAP node software implementation suggests and supports the use of
Apache Cayenne Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.

Apache Cayenne supports various database engines, notably, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server.

Creation of database objects is made simple thanks to the graphical modeler application,
provided as a part of Cayenne.

Process of creating a database model is well described in the project official documentation [CAYDOC]_
and there is no need to repeat it in this document.
